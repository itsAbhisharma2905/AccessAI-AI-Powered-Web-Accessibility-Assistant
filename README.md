🚀 AccessAI – AI-Powered Web Accessibility Assistant
📌 Overview
AccessAI is an AI-driven accessibility tool designed to help users with disabilities navigate websites, fill out forms, and access information hands-free using voice commands and AI automation. It enhances digital accessibility by integrating speech recognition, text-to-speech, and AI-powered assistance into web browsing.

🎯 Problem Statement
Over 1 billion people worldwide face disabilities, yet most websites remain inaccessible to them. Users with visual impairments, motor disabilities, or cognitive challenges struggle with digital navigation. AccessAI solves this by providing a voice-controlled AI assistant that enables hands-free browsing and seamless interaction with digital content.

🛠️ Domains & Technologies Used
🤖 Artificial Intelligence (AI/ML) Technology: AIML (Artificial Intelligence Markup Language)
🌐 Web Development Technology: React (Frontend), FastAPI (Backend)
🎙️ Speech Recognition Technology: Web Speech API, Pyttsx3
♿ Assistive Technology Technology: ARIA roles, Accessibility APIs
🚀 Key Features
✅ Voice Commands for Navigation – Open links, scroll, interact with pages. ✅ Text-to-Speech & Speech-to-Text – Enables hands-free web browsing. ✅ AI-Powered Assistance – Understands user intent & provides relevant responses. ✅ Form Filling Automation – Helps users fill forms via voice. ✅ Seamless Web Accessibility Enhancements – ARIA roles, contrast adjustments, and keyboard-free browsing.

🛠️ How It Works?
1️⃣ User speaks a command → "Go to homepage" 2️⃣ AI processes the request using AIML & Speech API 3️⃣ AI executes the action (redirect, read content, fill forms) 4️⃣ Text-to-Speech feedback confirms the action

💡 Why AccessAI Stands Out?
🚀 First-of-its-kind AI assistant for real-time web accessibility 🚀 Voice-based navigation makes web browsing effortless for disabled users 🚀 High social impact – Promotes digital inclusion for all users

📌 Deployment Plan
Frontend: Deploy React on Vercel
Backend: Deploy FastAPI on Render
Demo Link: Coming Soon!
